# Map App
I created this app to play around and get used to using **MapKit**. The app has *5 points-of-interest* in-built which the user can choose from. The location is highlighted when chosen, and to show more info about the point-of-interest a sheet also pops up. This app also helped me understand and use basic animations and transitions. The app is built using the **MVVM architecture**
