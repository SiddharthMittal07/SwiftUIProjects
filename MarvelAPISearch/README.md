# MARVEL API SEARCH APP
I created this app to learn fetching and using JSON data from APIs using the URLSession basic swift approach. I was fortunate enough to find the Marvel API which can be found [here](https://developer.marvel.com). To use this app, you have to create an account there and use the PUBLIC and PRIVATE keys in the MarvelAPISearchApp.swift file. The app consists of 4 tabs showing Marvel Comics, Events, Stories and gives the user capability to search for their favorite marvel characters. The **MVVM Architecture** was very helpful here to isolate different parts of the app.
