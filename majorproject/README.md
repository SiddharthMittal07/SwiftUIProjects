# MAJOR PROJECT APP
I created this app to supplement my university major project. My contribution to the project involves using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to predict cancer in the brain using MRI images. I developed a website and an app using flutter to show my literature research, the algorithms used, the results retrieved and also provide user functionality to the user to upload MRI image and process it the machine learning models and show the result. I redesigned the flutter app and created this app. 
The website can be found [here](https://brain-cancer-detection.herokuapp.com).
